### Prework -- Or what to do before you get here.

As your first assignment, [create a new Issue in the class repo](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/ROR--2015--SPRING/issues/new) with the _raw_ contents of this file as the "description" (read [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for more).  Hint: look for the "Raw" button. You should end up with a bunch of checkboxes just like those below, thanks to [the way that Github interprets Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). As you complete tasks, check off the corresponding checkboxes. This is your **Work In Progress (WIP) Issue**. You'll create a new one for each assignment to show your work and track your progress.

* [ ] [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh) on your Mac
    * [ ] Open `Terminal.app`
    * [ ] [Install Homebrew and the `brew` command](http://brew.sh/#install)
    * [ ] Read [the Homebrew Wiki](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/share/doc/homebrew#readme) to learn more about Homebrew
* [ ] Using the `brew` command, install the following packages:
    * [ ] `zsh`
    * [ ] `git`
* [ ] [Install Caskroom](http://caskroom.io)
* [ ] Using `brew cask`, install the following applications:
    * [ ] [Google Chrome](http://google.com/chrome)
    * [ ] [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com)
    * [ ] [HipChat](http://www.hipchat.com)
* [ ] [Complete the "Hello World" Github guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
    * [ ] Add a link to your new Github repo as a comment in your WIP Issue.
* [ ] Create _another_ new repository called `TIY-Assignments`
    * [ ] Check the box to create an initial `README.md` file
    * [ ] Select the `CC0` -- "Creative Commons" license for your work
    * [ ] Add a link to your `TIY-Assignments` repo as a comment to your WIP Issue
* NOTE: The above looks like a lot, but those tasks go quickly. The following items require, and deserve, more time. Don't put them off!    
* [ ] Read and complete the exercises for the [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/). The command line is another name for the terminal. There are about 20 commands you'll use all the time on the command line, and it's helpful to have them memorized so we can use them right away.    
* [ ] Read the book [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/). That's a terrific tutorial if you've never written any code before, or if you've never worked with Ruby before. You can read the original version on the author's website for free, or follow the link he gives to purchase the latest version. For this assignment, the exercises in the book are optional.
* [ ] Close this issue! You're done!

#### Extracurricular Activities

Regardless of how good you are at typing, a lot of the mistakes you make at first will be simple typographic errors. If you _don't_ know how to touch type (i.e. without looking at the keyboard), start practicing _now_ with http://www.keybr.com/. Typing code is different from typing other documents; more characters are used, and certain letter combinations come up more frequently. If you're fairly confident in your typing ability, try working through the Ruby on Rails lessons on http://typing.io.
 
There are two books that I suggest you start reading. They're both available in digital format on various devices, and they're both relatively easy reads:

* [_Getting Things Done_ by David Allen](http://j.mp/134jABk)
* [_Pragmatic Thinking and Learning_ by Andy Hunt](http://j.mp/1D5nmu8)
