# 20 -- Javascript, or maybe Yavascript

### It might be a soft 'j'. I'm not sure but apparently you just code for an extended period of time. It's supposed to be wild.

## Description

The problem with doing TodoMVC without Javascript is we have to have all those buttons. The problem with doing TodoMVC with Javascript is you guys don't know any Javascript yet. So we're going to fix that second problem. Start by reading this good, brief(ish) [overview of the language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) (skip the last section, on memory leaks). 

Take that introduction, and what you know about Ruby, and make a new Rails app to compare the languages. The new app should have two resources, similarities and differences. Each similarity (or difference) should have two attributes: title and text. Each resource should have a page listing the titles of every item in the category, and the title should link to a page that has the title and text. The list page should also have a link to create a new similarity (or difference), and the detail page for each similarity (or difference) should have a link to edit and a button to delete it. Create as many entries as you can for the similarities and differences between the two languages.

Javascript is an increasingly powerful and ubiquitous language that can be used in many different circumstances and blah, blah, blah. We're going to use it in the context for which it was originally intended: working in the browser, to do things other languages can't. Read over the [Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction), and type out pages for the first three [examples of using Javascript on a web page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Examples). Since those pages don't have any Ruby in them, they can go in the `public/` folder of your new app.

### Bonus Thing To Do
I just pushed this morning's work to a new repository at http://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/rails_todo_mvc.git, and realized that we didn't get the "Mark all complete" button to work yet. So, that's something you could do.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

You will learn a little about Javascript, most of which will be discovering that you already know some things about Javascript because you know some things about Ruby.

### Deliverables

* A Rails app called `programming_languages` in a new repository 
* Update your wiki afterwards

Great intro book for js and programming in general

I'd ask you to read it, but it's nearly 500 pages long. Worth reading
